# LocalSense-EstimoteKalmanFilter
While working on the LocalSense projet we added Estimotes beacons to our architecture.  They worked great though it quickly
became obvious that accuracy was at a premium so we put in several tricks and filters including a Kalman filter to better track the beacons in relation to the base.

Use this code at your own risk and feel free to contribute to enhance it :)
